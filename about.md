““_To be a warrior is not a simple matter of wishing to be one. It is rather an endless struggle that will go on to the very last moment of our lives. Nobody is born a warrior, in exactly the same way that nobody is born an average man. We make ourselves into one or the other_.”” -**Carlos Castaneda**

I'm a Linux system admin interested in the DevOps and Security niche. I've also been producing technical content for a long time. You can read some of my published work from the links below.

I'm currently working as a technical writer for [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev){:target="_blank"}. I primarily work with highly technical pieces but am comfortable with opinionated productions too. 

So, feel free to [contact me](http://rubaiat-hossain.com/contact) if you're looking for a reliable engineer to produce in-depth technical content that successfully engages your audience and fulfills business objectives.
