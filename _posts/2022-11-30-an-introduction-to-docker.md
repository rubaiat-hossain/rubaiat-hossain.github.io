Docker is a platform that allows developers to build, test, and ship applications
effectively via packages called containers. A container is a standardized unit with
everything needed to run an application, including the runtime, dependencies,
configuration settings, etc.

Containers speed up the entire software development lifecycle by removing
redundancies from different stages of development. Plus, a curated number of
ready-made tools are available that make container management effortless and
allow developers to focus on the outcome rather than the process.

## Why Use Docker?

In short, Docker eliminates repetitive tasks and provides tooling to make
application development painless. From my personal experience, I'll list the
following five reasons to use Docker for your next project.

### Ships Software Faster

Docker containers give a head start by providing [ready-made container images](https://hub.docker.com/) that
speed up the development process. You can create multi-platform applications
without worrying about dependency errors or configuration issues centered around
operating systems. Data shows that Docker users ship software 7X faster than their
counterparts.

### Provides Standardized Operations

As containerized applications require less overhead, it's easy to deploy them and
identify issues. Also, the ability to spin up containers from images makes it easy to
roll back for remediation. Moreover, Docker's seamless integration with popular
development tools makes coding productive.

### Software Moves Fluidly

Developers can effectively move applications built using Docker containers across
different platforms. Docker images are easy to port, and you can take one from
your local machine to production servers within seconds. Plus, all major cloud
providers support Docker and supply required tooling.

### Maintains CI/CD Benefits
Containerized applications help enterprises reap the actual benefits of [CI/CD
methodologies](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-ci-cd). Docker accelerates software deployment by removing conflicts
between tech stacks. Since containers enforce standardized environments,
developers don't need to deal with cross-environment bugs.

### Containers Save Money
Containers are very business-friendly in terms of production and maintenance
costs. As they require fewer resources than traditional virtual machines, you can
run a lot more code on each server. So, Docker improves resource utilization and
saves a ton on billing.


## Docker's Impact on the Development Ecosystem
Docker containers solve many common problems enterprises had to deal with
legacy virtual machines. That's why containers have become the de-facto choice
for developing cloud-native applications. With containers, developers can rapidly
spin up working services or customize them as required.

Containerized applications also aid in making incremental changes to the software
without interrupting working functionalities. Docker improves modern CI/CD
models and ensures developers are rolling out new features at a steady pace.

The ecosystem around Docker has evolved heavily since 2013. And with the
emergence of reliable tools like the Kubernetes orchestration platform, Docker has
cemented its position as the platform of choice for building highly distributed
microservices.
